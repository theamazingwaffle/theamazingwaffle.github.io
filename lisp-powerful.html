      <h2>The basics.</h2>
      <p>In order for me to explain why the above affirmation is true i
        need the reader to be familiar with a few concepts: Expressions in lisp,
        lists and <code>EVAL</code>.
        <br>
        All functions, macros and special operators on this page will be written in
        <code>ALL CAPS</code> because that is the convention and is a clear way to tell
        what i mean.
        If you know the basics already, skip to <a href="#macros">macros</a>
      </p>
      <h2>Expression based language.</h2>
      <p>In lisp, everything is an expression that returns something, be it a number,
        string, boolean value or whatever. We will write the return value of something
        via <code>=> VALUE</code>, for example:
        <pre><code>CL-USER> 1
=> 1
CL-USER> (+ 1 2)
=> 3
CL-USER> (if t
             "this is true"
             "fake")
=> "this is true"
CL-USER> (if nil
             "this is true"
             "fake")
=> "fake"</code></pre>
        <code>CL-USER></code> is just the interactive prompt. Pay attention to the <code>IF</code> above.
        It's like a function that takes 3 arguments and returns the first one
        it's truthy. Truthy, as in non-<code>NIL</code>. If it's anything, but <code>NIL</code> it
        evaluates the first expression and returns the result of its
        evaluation. Otherwise, it returns the second expression.
        <br>
        In <code>&amp;body</code> clauses, the result of the last expression is returned.
        In the following example, upon calling <code>(MY-FUNCTION)</code>, 5 will be returned.
        <pre><code>(defun my-function ()
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5)
CL-USER> (my-function)
=> 5</pre></code>
        There are more things about expressions, but for now this shoulds suffice.
      </p>
      <h2>Lists in lisp</h2>
      <p>
        Lisp stands for "List processor" and it's right. In lisp, to create a
        list, you just put a single quote around a pair of parens.
        <pre><code>CL-USER> '(1 2 3 4)
=> (1 2 3 4)</pre></code>
        The printed lists don't need the quote in front so they are just printed
        like parens surrounding items.
        <br>
        Lists can also hold many different types.
        <pre><code>CL-USER> '(1 "two" 3.0 four)
=> (1 "two" 3.0 four)
CL-USER</code></pre>
        <code>four</code> in the above example is a <em>symbol</em>.
        Symbols in lisp are a data type used for representing names of
        all kinds. We can bind a variable, a function, a macro, whatever
        to a symbol.
        <br>
        There can even be nested lists, they don't need to be quoted because
        the contents of lists don't evaluate. This also explains the symbol
        situation. If those symbols were variable we'd get the value instead
        of the symbol, but lisp doesn't evaluate the contents of a quoted list.
        For optional evaluation there is quasiquote, which i'll mention later.
        <pre><code>
CL-USER> '(1 ((2 3) 4) five)
=> (1 ((2 3) 4) five)</code></pre>
      </p>
      <h2><code>EVAL</code></h2>
      <p>
        In lisp, <code>EVAL</code> is used for evaluating an s-expression.
        Unlike python, where <code>eval</code> evaluates a string, in lisp,
        it evaluates an s-expression. An s-expression is either an atom (value)
        or a list of s-expressions.
        <pre><code>
CL-USER> (eval 2) ;; in this case, 2 is an atom
=> 2
CL-USER> (eval '(my-function)) ;; in this case, it's a list with a single element
=> 5</code></pre>
        How convenient! If it is called with a list, eval treats it as lisp code!
      </p>

      <h2>Macros</h2>
      <p>
        I have a crazy idea now. What if we create a function that manipulates lists.
        What's so crazy about it? Well, we'll pass that function lisp code. What? Yes,
        we will just quote the code to make it into a list. Suppose we wrote a function
        <code>RECURSIVE-REVERSE</code> which recursively reverses a list.
        <pre><code>CL-USER> (recursive-reverse '(1 (2 3 +) boolean-value if)
=> (if boolean-value (+ 3 2) 1)</code></pre>
        Oh! We got valid lisp code as a result. Now what if we <code>EVAL</code> it?
        <pre><code>CL-USER> (defvar boolean-value nil)
CL-USER> (eval (recursive-reverse '(1 (2 3 +) boolean-value if))
=> 1</code></pre>
        Firstly, we define a variable <code>boolean-value</code> in order for it to hold
        a value for our if. Now we reverse the list and pass the result to <code>EVAL</code>.
        It's evaluated and returns 1, because <code>boolean-value</code> is <code>NIL</code>
        and it chooses the second branch.
        <br>
        Now think about what we have just done. We manipulated lisp code as if
        we manipulated any ol' list. Let's write something a little useful now, shall we?
        <h2>Babby's first code manipulating function: <code>WHEN</code></h2>
        We have a little annoyance with <code>IF</code>: It's structure is
        <code>(if boolean true-case &optional false-case)</code><br>
        How do we write more statements in a branch? We use begin.
        <pre><code>(if boolean
  (begin
    (display "this is so true")
    (newline)))</code></pre>
        Note: we didn't write the <code>false-case</code> because let's say for our example
        we don't need it. It is optional, as marked by the <code>&optional</code>
        in <code>IF</code>'s prototype.
        <br>
        <code>BEGIN</code>groups statements together, but it can get tedious to
        write it all the time there is a single branch if. Why don't we fix it by
        writing a function that will put <code>BEGIN</code> there for us?
        <pre><code>(defun baby-when (condition &rest body)
  `(if ,condition
       (begin
        ,@body)))</code></pre>
        <pre><code>CL-USER> (baby-when 't '(display "this is so true")
                    '(newline))
(IF T
    (BEGIN (DISPLAY "this is so true") (NEWLINE)))</code></pre>
        We define a function with <code>DEFUN</code>, called <code>baby-when</code>.
        It takes 2 arguments: <code>condition</code> and <code>body</code> which is
        a list containing the <code>&rest</code> of the arguments provided to it.
        What we do next is use a backtick (<code>`</code>) to create a
        <strong>quasiquoted</strong> list. In a quasiquoted list, all the elements
        prefixed by a comma (<code>,</code>) are evaluated and the result gets put
        into the list, instead of the element itself. If we use <code>,@</code>
        the following expression, which must <em>evaluate</em> to a list is
        <em>spliced</em>.
        <pre><code>`((list 1 2 3) ,(list 4 5 6) ,@(list 7 8 9))
=> ((list 1 2 3) (4 5 6) 7 8 9)</code></pre>
        So, when calling <code>baby-when</code>, it replaces things, like in
        templates.
        <h2>Babby's first macro</h2>
        To use <code>baby-when</code>, we need to quote all its
        arguments and put it inside an <code>EVAL</code>.
        <pre><code>(eval
  (baby-when 't
    '(display "hello")
    '(newline)))</code></pre>
        Now that's a lot of boilerplate, is it even worth it this way?
        I don't think it is. Luckily, we can define baby-when as a macro.
        <pre><code>(defmacro baby-when (condition &rest body)
  `(if ,condition
       (begin
        ,@body)))</code></pre>
        Notice how the only bit we changed is the function with which we
        define, with <code>DEFMACRO</code>, however it has massively changed
        in terms of usability.
        <pre><code>(baby-when t
  (display "hello")
  (newline))</code></pre>
        This, my friends, is the power of macros. We manipulated code as if
        we were manipulating a data structure, as if we were filling some
        template. And macros aren't only used as simple templates, they are
        written in lisp too, so you could have a macro that does some calculations,
        calls some lisp functions and do whatever before even getting to the
        code itself. And they're specific to lisp because in other languages code isn't data.
        In other languages, the maximum you could do is manipulate strings (which is painful).
        True, you can write your own parser, tokenize your code and manipulate
        it that way but oh well you just created a lisp. Plus, other languages
        don't have <em>macros</em>, they might have eval, but then you'd still
        be wrapping everything in an <code>eval(...)</code> which is not cool.
